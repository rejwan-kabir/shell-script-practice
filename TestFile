BREs provide a mechanism, known as backreferences, for saying “match whatever an
earlier part of the regular expression matched.” There are two steps to using backref-
erences. The first step is to enclose a subexpression in \( and \). There may be up to
nine enclosed subexpressions within a single pattern, and they may be nested.
